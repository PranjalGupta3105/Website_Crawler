# Website_Crawler
Hye, 
This is a simple website crawler I build following up the lesson @ "TheNewBoston". Bucky you were amazing at Explainations all through. 
What is do'es?
It scraps the website's link and initializes the crawled file with the Initial or starting link. Next, is what it has got associated threads with the program
I call it spiders that crawl along the entire web page(initial one) and automatically trace within all of the links associated with the first page 
the bot(spider) also keeps them into a queue  file this queue file is refered to by another spider (currently associated with none of the thread) 
and the  next spider picks up this link and starts crawling this also so untill the page and all of the associated pages are crawler the program
does the task).


Had a Fun and all through a different experience , I am freaking lov'ing Python now!!!
